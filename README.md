# ts-i18n-plugin

## ⚠️ I made this project to experiment with the TypeScript compiler API. Do not use it in any serious project.

This project was made before [Template Literal Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html) were available. They could provide the same behaviour with some explicit imports.
